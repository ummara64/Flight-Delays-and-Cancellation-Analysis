üöÄ **Portfolio Project: Analyzing Flight Delays and Cancellations in 2015** ‚úàÔ∏è

As a Data Scientist, I recently completed an in-depth analysis of flight delays and cancellations for the year 2015. This project involved extensive data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to derive meaningful insights. Here‚Äôs a summary of what I accomplished:

**Objectives:**
1. Identify the airline with the highest percentage of delayed or canceled flights.
2. Determine which airports had the most flight cancellations.
3. Explore geographical patterns in flight delays to see if certain regions or airports experience more delays.
4. Calculate the average flight delay for each day of the week and compare weekends versus weekdays.

**Process:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and irrelevant columns to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Integration:** Merged datasets containing flight delay details and airport geographical information.
- **Calculations and Analysis:** 
  - Calculated total delays by summing departure and arrival delays.
  - Identified the airline with the highest percentage of delays/cancellations.
  - Determined airports with the most cancellations.
  - Analyzed geographical delay patterns using longitude and latitude data.
  - Computed average delays for each day of the week and compared weekday vs. weekend delays.
- **Visualization:** Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations, including scatter plots to depict geographical delay patterns.

**Achievements:**
- **Key Insights:**
  - Identified the airline with the highest percentage of delays/cancellations.
  - Highlighted airports with the most cancellations, providing a clear picture of operational challenges.
  - Revealed geographical hotspots for delays, aiding in understanding regional operational efficiencies.
  - Demonstrated that weekends or certain weekdays might be more prone to delays, aiding in operational planning.
  
- **Visual Impact:** Created compelling visualizations that clearly communicate the findings, making complex data easily understandable.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas:** For efficient data cleaning and merging.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For creating detailed and informative plots.

This project not only enhanced my data science skills but also provided valuable insights into the aviation industry‚Äôs operational challenges.
